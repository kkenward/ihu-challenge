IHU Challenge 
- Due by Dec. 2nd

Goal:
To put all your skill and ability to learn into creating a 2 page website. The site will be simple, it is more about what you ultimately put into it.

Minimum:
x. javascript web app, when loaded, shows 'Hello' in 26 pt font, centered on screen
x. when word is clicked, it goes to page 2 which shows 'Goodbye', in 26 pt font centered on screen
x. it uses a javascript framework IE: Backbone, Ember, Angular, Knockout, Meteor, Etc.
x. it is a single page app, so the 2 'pages' are just re-rendering the DOM in javascript

Extra:
x. Yoeman boilerplate app
x. Grunt build processes
x. Bower install of javascript libraries like jquery
x. HTML templating, IE: handlebars
x. javascript tests
x. JSLint passes
x. proper use of Routes in framework to show 2 different pages
x. CSS precompiler, IE: stylus, less, sass
x  - extra credit grunt task to compile css
