IHU Challenge 
- Due by Dec. 2nd

Goal:
To put all your skill and ability to learn into creating a 2 page website. The site will be simple, it is more about what you ultimately put into it.

Minimum:
. javascript web app, when loaded, shows 'Hello' in 26 pt font, centered on screen
. when word is clicked, it goes to page 2 which shows 'Goodbye', in 26 pt font centered on screen
. it uses a javascript framework IE: Backbone, Ember, Angular, Knockout, Meteor, Etc.
. it is a single page app, so the 2 'pages' are just re-rendering the DOM in javascript

Extra:
. Yoeman boilerplate app
. Grunt build processes
. Bower install of javascript libraries like jquery
. HTML templating, IE: handlebars
. javascript tests
. JSLint passes
. proper use of Routes in framework to show 2 different pages
. CSS precompiler, IE: stylus, less, sass
  - extra credit grunt task to compile css
